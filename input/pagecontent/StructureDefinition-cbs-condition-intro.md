The Case Based Surveillance (CBS) Condition of Interest is the core condition by which filtering to programs should occur. For all other conditions included as part of the case report, the base [FHIR Condition](http://www.hl7.org/fhir/r4/condition.html) resource should be used. This means there SHALL only be one (1) Condition of Interest profile.
